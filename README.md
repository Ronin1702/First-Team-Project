# First-Team-Project
This is the GitHub repo for our first team project (FTP) with branch protection turned on.

# User Story:
As a traveler,    
I want to know what hotels to avoid in the area I am staying,   
so that I may have a comfortable overnight hostel/lodging experience    

# Acceptance Criteria:
Given I am using Krapyak to know what places to avoid,   
When I open 'Krapyak'   
Then I am asked where I am staying with a user input box   
Then I see a box with webpage advertiser   
When I click on the drop down   
Then I can enter the city I am staying, and if in API box will show autofill drop    down selections to choose
When I select my location and submit   
Then I am brought to another page where I am shown worst hotels   
Then hotels are listed in descending order from most reviews/lowest rating    
When I click on a hotel   
Then I am brought to its yelp webpage
