# First-Team-Project
This is the GitHub repo for our first team project (FTP) with branch protection turned on.

## Branche Protection Stuff
<li> The video in "06.3 Activity Files" indicates that we should set up the collaborative repo in this way</li>
<li> The old "Include Adminstrator" option is replaced by the "Do not allow bypassing the above settings".</li>.
<li> We won't be able to directly edit the Main branch.</li>
<li> To "build" a new branch type: git checkout -b examplebranch. (You may use /,-,to distinguish branches.)</li>
<li> As long as you're in the right branch, you can simply "git push" once you're done commiting, without the following "origin examplebranch".</li>
<li> <h1>Before the begin of any of your work, you shall always return to the Main branche by typing: git checkout main, to do a "git pull" request.</li>
